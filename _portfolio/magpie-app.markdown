Magpie is a hunt app created with the intention to get more people to tour the Spokane Sculpture Walk, as a collaboration between EWU and Spokane Arts. The idea of using an entertaining way to obtain information and locate landmarks drove the Magpie concept. My part in this project was to redesign the user flows and optimize the Sketch file with nested symbols.
