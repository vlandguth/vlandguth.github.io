She successfully shipped products to customers, conducted research projects, and built style guides for our team. She is a natural designer with a lot of deliberation and thoughtful decisions in her design work. Her flexibility and energy helped her tackle all types of challenges with different stakeholders during all stages of the design process. I would recommend Valerie for any UX position. Given the opportunity I would hire her again!"
