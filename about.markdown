I am dedicated to solving problems for users while creating enjoyable experiences. I am studying Visual Communication Design and User Experience Design at Eastern Washington University. I strive to be the best UX and Web Designer by staying curious and always learning. I love working in a collaborative environment, giving and receiving feedback. Many different perspectives improve the user experience. Throughout my education, I have Tutored at EWU in Web Design and UX and interned at INRIX Inc. At INRIX, I created style guides for the Design Team to use to maintain consistency and created a Weather.com experience for a connected-car software, OpenCar. I also conducted usability testing on other OpenCar applications and presented my results to project stakeholders.
