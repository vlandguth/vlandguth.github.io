<h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a student at Eastern Washington University, studying Visual Communication Design. I am hoping to graduate with a bachelors degree after Fall 2018. I am 18 years old and my birthday is in July so I cannot wait for the Summer! In the Summer, I
      like to go hiking, spend time at Lake Washington, and play Badminton in my backyard with my Husband and friends. When I am not doing homework, I like to play the guitar and play video games with my Husband. My favorite gaming consoles are the Nintendo
      Switch and the Gamecube.</p>
